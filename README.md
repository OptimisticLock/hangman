# Hangman

Today we will be implementing a self-playing version of the popular game Hangman. 
We will be using the API hosted here for the actual game mechanics, but you will have 
to implement the guessing strategy:
http://hangman-api.herokuapp.com/api 

Note that this API is based on code here:
https://github.com/despo/hangman

And there is a playable version here:
http://hangman-api.herokuapp.com/ 

Please proceed as you normally would, feeling free to utilize Google or even old code you may 
have lying around. The goal is to have a minimum playable version built and then iterate 
to make it better within the 2 hour window. Afterwards, we will spend some time talking 
about your solution and why you chose to implement it and how it could be done better.

### Roadmap: 

* letters in orders of occurrence
* use the dictionary 
* cache and reuse tokens or their subsets: https://github.com/OptimisticLock/hangman/blob/master/debug/Heuristics.md
